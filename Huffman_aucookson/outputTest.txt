Computer science is the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design 
and use of computers. It involves the study of algorithms that process, store, and communicate digital 
information. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational 
systems.[1]

Its fields can be divided into a variety of theoretical and practical disciplines. Some fields, such as 
computational complexity theory (which explores the fundamental properties of computational and intractable 
problems), are highly abstract, while fields such as computer graphics emphasize real-world visual applications. 
Other fields focus on challenges in implementing computation. For example, programming language theory considers 
various approaches to the description of computation, while the study of computer programming itself investigates 
various aspects of the use of programming languages and complex systems. Human–computer interaction considers the
challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible to humans.
